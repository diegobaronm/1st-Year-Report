\chapter*{Abstract}
Different algorithms have been trained by the ATLAS collaboration to separate true hadronically decaying taus from QCD jets. The efficiency of these algorithms is compared in simulation and data and correction factors are derived to account for the differences that may arise from the simulation limitations. Our study makes use of $Z\to\tauh l$ events highly boosted in the transverse plane,, where $l=e,\mu$,  to evaluate the performance of the tau-ID algorithms for high-$\pt$ taus.
