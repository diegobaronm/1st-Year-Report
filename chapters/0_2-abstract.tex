\chapter*{Abstract}
Different algorithms have been trained by the ATLAS collaboration to separate true hadronically decaying taus from QCD jets. The efficiency of these algorithms is compared in simulation and data and correction factors are derived to account for the differences that may arise from the simulation limitations. Our study makes use of $Z\to\tauh l$ events highly boosted in the transverse plane, where $l=e,\mu$,  to evaluate the performance of the tau-ID algorithms for high-$\pt$ taus. The scale factors are defined as
\begin{equation}
	C_{\text{ID}}=\frac{\mathcal{E}_{\text{MC}}}{\mathcal{E}_{\text{Data}}},\nonumber
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{E}$ is the efficiency of the algorithms measured in the data and the simulation. In this report we present the value obtained for the scale factors for the classifier \textit{tight-ID} working point. The values are $C_{\text{Tight-ID}}=0.989\pm 0.012\text{(stat)}\pm 0.024\text{(lumi)}\pm 0.028\text{(sys)}$ for the muon-tau final state and $C_{\text{Tight-ID}}=0.974\pm 0.014\text{(stat)}\pm 0.023\text{(lumi)}\pm 0.029\text{(sys)}$ for the electron-tau final state.
