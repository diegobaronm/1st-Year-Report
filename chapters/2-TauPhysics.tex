\chapter{Tau physics overview}\label{chap:relatedwork}
This chapter is a review of the Tau lepton properties. They include the nature of this particle, its interactions with other Standard Model (SM) particles, its main decay modes and the physics implications of the so called Lepton Universality (LU), one of the SM predictions.  

\section{The Tau Lepton}
The Tau is a spin $\frac{1}{2}$, electrically charged particle that belongs to the same family of particles as the electron, the muon and the neutrinos, they are all called leptons. Leptons are elementary particles that interact only via the weak and electromagnetic interactions, for the latter case only if they have electric charge.
